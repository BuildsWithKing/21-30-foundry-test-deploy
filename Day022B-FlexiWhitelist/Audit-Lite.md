# FlexiWhitelist Audit-Lite Report  
Audit-lite review by Michealking (@BuildsWithKing)  
Created: 21st of Sept, 2025

## Scope
- Contract: FlexiWhitelist.sol
- Test Coverage: Unit + Fuzz (Foundry)
- Review Type: Self-conducted audit-lite

---

## Findings Summary
- Critical Issues: None  
- High Severity: None  
- Medium Severity: None  
- Low Severity: 1 (Gas optimization)  
- Informational: Few notes on naming consistency  

---

## Detailed Review

### âœ… Security
- No reentrancy risks (no external calls inside state-changing logic).  
- Proper access control: Only king can whitelist/unwhitelist.  
- Fuzz tests confirm multiple random users can register/unregister safely.  

### âš  Gas / Optimization
- getRegisteredUsers and getWhitelistedUsers functions could be optimized with limited storage reads inside loops

```solidity
if (whitelistStatus[userAddresses[i]] == WhitelistStatus.Whitelisted)
```

Each iteration reads from storage (expensive).

ðŸ”§ Fix: Cache into memory once.
```solidity
address[] storage _users = userAddresses;
for (uint256 i = _offset; i < _end; i++) {
    address user = _users[i];
    if (whitelistStatus[user] == WhitelistStatus.Whitelisted) { ... }
}
```
âœ… Cuts repeated SLOADs.

### â„¹ Informational
- Function naming is clear and consistent.  
- Tests include fuzzing for edge cases.  

---

## Conclusion
The contract passed all unit + fuzz tests.  
No security-critical or high-severity issues were found.  
FlexiWhitelist is safe to deploy for typical whitelist use cases.
