# 🔥 30-Days Solidity Mastery Challenge: Phase 2 (Day 21–30)

### 🚀 Refactoring, Testing, Deployment & Foundry Mastery

This repository contains the advanced phase of my 30-day Solidity mastery challenge — *Days 21–30*.  
Focus: Refactor previous projects, write *Foundry tests, deploy smart contracts to **Sepolia Testnet*, and verify functionality.

---
> 🟢 New to Phase 2?  
> Phase 2 focuses on testing, deployment, scripting, and production-level best practices.  
> You’ll see the same projects from Days 1–20, but now *refactored, fully tested, and verified*.

> “Consistency + testing = mastery. I’m leveling up smart contract quality and deployment skills.”
